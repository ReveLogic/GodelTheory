# Why You Can’t Prove Gödel’s Theorem

## Abstract

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem stands as one of the most profound and revolutionary results in the history of science, mathematics, and even language. Despite its fundamental importance, the theorem remains shrouded in confusion due to its peculiar nature, which relies on self-reference and touches the edge of paradox. Gödel’s work is often misunderstood or overlooked in academia, partly because it challenges foundational assumptions and has been the subject of intense debate among various schools of mathematical thought.

Interestingly, the essence of Gödel’s theorem resonates across cultures, with intuitive parallels found in wisdom texts and linguistic traditions. However, its most rigorous and demonstrable form arises in the context of Peano Arithmetic, where it exposes the inherent limitations of formal systems. The goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between intuition and rigor by offering a clear and accessible explanation of Gödel’s theorem, making it comprehensible while preserving its mathematical depth and precision. Through this exploration, we aim to illuminate the theorem’s relevance not just to mathematics but to broader domains of human knowledge.

## Introduction

### Gödel and the Revolution of Self-Reference

Kurt Gödel’s *Incompleteness Theorems* (1931) fundamentally reshaped our understanding of formal logic and mathematics. Gödel proved that in any sufficiently powerful formal system, there exist true statements that cannot be proven within the system. This groundbreaking discovery relied on *self-reference*, where Gödel constructed statements that refer to their own provability, such as “this statement cannot be proven.” This revealed the inherent limitations of logical systems and established a profound connection between truth, proof, and meta-reasoning.

Gödel’s work laid the foundation for modern explorations of necessity, possibility, and provability—the central concerns of *modal logic*.

### Gödel's Impact on Linguistics and the Theory of Meaning

Gödel's insights into formal systems have had profound implications for linguistics, particularly in understanding the structure and limitations of language. Just as Gödel showed that no formal system can capture all truths, modern linguistic theories recognize that human language cannot be fully formalized. His ideas resonate in *generative grammar* and *semantic theory*, where self-reference and recursion are seen as essential features of language. Gödel’s work also informs the study of paradoxes in language, such as the Liar Paradox, deepening our understanding of how meaning and truth interact in natural languages.

### Gödel in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence

In computer science, Gödel’s theorems highlight the limits of computation and formal algorithms. His results directly inspired Alan Turing’s work on the Halting Problem, showing that there are limits to what can be computed. Gödel’s notions of self-reference and incompleteness underpin key developments in theoretical computer science, such as *complexity theory* and *automated theorem proving*. In artificial intelligence, Gödel’s ideas challenge the pursuit of creating systems capable of full human-like reasoning. While Gödel’s work emphasizes the inherent limitations of formal systems, it also inspires AI research into meta-reasoning and self-referential algorithms, which attempt to model aspects of human cognition.

## Gödel’s Theorem as a Self-Referential Statement

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem can itself be seen as a self-referential construct. It asserts that within any sufficiently powerful, consistent formal system, there are statements that are *true but unprovable*. The theorem itself operates on the principles of self-reference, as it essentially demonstrates its own truth through its construction.

### Gödel’s Theorem (Linguistic Form)

Gödel's theorem states:

- *“This statement is not provable.”*
- *“This system cannot prove its consistency.”*

Together with the theorem itself (the linguistic form), these statements are *self-referential and unprovable*. In other terms, Godel's theorem includes *itself* along with the two assertions. Thus, as a whole, the linguistic formulation of it does not require a proof. This peculiar feature might be interesting to review multiple times as it is not obvious.

### Further explanation on Why Gödel’s Theorem is Self-Referential and Needs No Further Proof

#### 1. Self-Reference of the Gödel Statements

The first example statement, *“This statement is not provable,”* directly refers to itself. It constructs a logical paradox if proven:

- If the statement is provable, then it asserts its own unprovability, which leads to a contradiction.
- If the statement is unprovable, its assertion is true, and it must remain unprovable.

This self-referential loop establishes its truth by being unprovable. Gödel’s theorem generalizes this idea, asserting that such statements must exist in any sufficiently complex formal system.

#### 2. Gödel’s Theorem as a Meta-Statement

Gödel’s theorem is itself a statement about formal systems:

- It asserts the existence of true but unprovable statements.
- Its truth depends on the logical construction of self-referential Gödel statements, which demonstrate the theorem by *existing*.

Since the theorem’s own construction proves its validity, it does not require a separate formal proof outside its logical framework. It is *true by self-reference*. This point as the reader might have noticed is repeated multiple times as it is subtle to understand.

#### 3. The Second Statement: “This system cannot prove its consistency”

The second statement further reinforces the self-referential nature of Gödel’s theorem. By claiming that a system cannot prove its consistency:

- If the system proves its consistency, it risks contradiction by falsifying the second assertion.
- If it does not prove its consistency, the statement remains unprovable but true.

This statement again reflects the essence of Gödel’s theorem: truths about the system’s limitations are unprovable within the system itself.

### Why Gödel’s Theorem is a Self-Sufficient Truth

1. **Gödel’s Theorem Demonstrates Itself:** Gödel’s theorem is an observation about the nature of formal systems, not just a claim. It shows that the construction of self-referential statements like *“This statement is not provable”* and *“This system cannot prove its consistency”* inherently validates its conclusions.
2. **The Self-Referential Loop:** Gödel’s theorem does not just claim that certain statements exist—it constructs them explicitly. These statements, being unprovable but true, directly embody the theorem’s claim.
3. **No External Proof Required:** By being self-referential, Gödel’s theorem proves itself in the act of stating it. The existence of Gödel statements like *“This statement is not provable”* is both the premise and the demonstration of the theorem.

## Gödel’s Theorem and the Possibility of Proof

We have just seen that Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem is self-referential and demonstrates its truth through the existence of unprovable but true statements. This seems to place Gödel’s theorem itself in a peculiar position: it is true by self-referencing but unprovable within the system itself.

However, Gödel's theorem can be "proved" in a formal (sub)system from a system that is more "powerful" than the system within which it is proved. This is why a "proof" of Gödel's theorem can be provided in the context of Peano's Arithmetic.

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems in Peano Arithmetic

#### Peano Arithmetic as a Formal System

**Peano Arithmetic (PA)** is a formal system designed to describe the natural numbers. It consists of:

- **Language:** First-order logic with equality, a constant `0`, a unary function `S(x)` (the successor function), and binary operations `+` (addition) and `·` (multiplication).
- **Axioms:**
  1. `∀x  S(x) ≠ 0`: Zero is not the successor of any number.
  2. `∀x, y  (S(x) = S(y) ⇒ x = y)`: The successor function is injective.
  3. `∀x  (x + 0 = x)`: Zero is the identity for addition.
  4. `∀x, y  (x + S(y) = S(x + y))`: Recursive definition of addition.
  5. `∀x  (x · 0 = 0)`: Zero annihilates multiplication.
  6. `∀x, y  (x · S(y) = (x · y) + x)`: Recursive definition of multiplication.
  7. **Induction schema:** For any formula `φ(x)`:
     ```
     φ(0) ∧ ∀x  (φ(x) ⇒ φ(S(x))) ⇒ ∀x  φ(x).
     ```
- **Provability:** A formula `φ` is provable in PA if there exists a finite sequence of logical deductions from the axioms that lead to `φ`.

#### Gödel Numbering

Gödel numbering is a method to encode the symbols, formulas, and proofs of a formal system as natural numbers. Below is a more detailed explanation of how this process works:

##### 1. Assigning Numbers to Individual Symbols

Each symbol in the formal language of the system (e.g., `0`, `S`, `+`, `·`, `=`, logical operators, and quantifiers) is assigned a unique natural number. For example:

- `0 → 1`
- `S → 2`
- `+ → 3`
- `· → 4`
- `= → 5`
- `∧ → 6`, and so on.

##### 2. Encoding Formulas as Sequences of Numbers

Formulas, which are sequences of symbols, are encoded as sequences of their assigned numbers. For example, the formula `S(0) = 0 + 0` would correspond to the sequence `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1]`. This sequence is then transformed into a single natural number using a technique such as the prime factorization method:

- Assign each position in the sequence a prime number: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …`.
- Compute the product of these primes raised to the power of the corresponding symbol numbers: `2^2 · 3^1 · 5^5 · 7^1 · 11^3 · 13^1`.
- The result is a unique Gödel number for the formula.

##### 3. Encoding Proofs

Proofs, which consist of finite sequences of formulas, are similarly encoded. Each formula in the proof is assigned its Gödel number, resulting in a sequence of Gödel numbers. This sequence is then converted into a single number using the same prime factorization method.

##### Key Idea

This encoding ensures that every symbol, formula, and proof can be uniquely represented by a single natural number. It allows properties of formulas (e.g., provability) to be expressed as arithmetic properties of their Gödel numbers. For example, the property *"formula `φ` is provable"* becomes:

```
Provable(n) ⇔ ∃m  Proof(m, n),
```

where `Proof(m, n)` asserts that `m` encodes a valid proof of the formula encoded by `n`.

#### Proving Gödel's Assertions

##### Assertion 1: "This Statement is Not Provable."

Gödel constructs a formula `G` in PA that asserts its own unprovability:

```
G ⇔ ¬Provable(gn(G)).
```

###### Steps to Prove

1. **Define Provability:** `Provable(x)` is a formula in PA that expresses *"the formula with Gödel number `x` is provable."*
2. **Construct the Gödel Sentence:** Using the diagonal lemma, construct a formula `G` such that:

```
G ⇔ ¬Provable(gn(G)).
```

Intuitively, `G` says: *"I am not provable."*

3. **Analyze `G`:**

- If `G` is provable, then `Provable(gn(G))` is true. But by the definition of `G`, `¬Provable(gn(G))` must also be true, leading to a contradiction.
- Therefore, `G` cannot be provable.
- If `G` is not provable, then `¬Provable(gn(G))` is true, and thus `G` is true.

###### Conclusion

`G` is true but not provable in PA. This demonstrates the incompleteness of PA: there exists a true statement that PA cannot prove.

##### Assertion 2: "This System Cannot Prove Its Consistency."

Gödel's second incompleteness theorem states that if PA is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency.

###### Steps to Prove

1. **Formalize Consistency:** The consistency of PA can be expressed as a formula `Con(PA)`, which asserts that no contradiction can be derived:

```
Con(PA) ⇔ ¬Provable(gn(⊥)),
```

where `⊥` represents a contradiction.

2. **Assume PA Proves `Con(PA)`:** If PA could prove `Con(PA)`, then PA would effectively be asserting its own consistency.

3. **Construct a Contradiction:**

- Using the Gödel sentence `G`, we know that if PA is consistent, `G` is true but not provable.
- However, proving `Con(PA)` in PA would enable PA to indirectly prove `G`, contradicting `G`'s unprovability.

###### Conclusion

If PA is consistent, it cannot prove `Con(PA)`. This establishes the inherent limitation of PA in proving its own consistency.

##### Summary

- Gödel's **first theorem** shows that there exist true but unprovable statements in any consistent formal system that includes PA.
- Gödel's **second theorem** shows that such a system cannot prove its own consistency, assuming it is consistent.

These theorems highlight the inherent limitations of formal systems like Peano Arithmetic in capturing all truths about arithmetic and ensuring their own reliability.

## The Source of All Confusion

The root of the paradoxical essence of Godel's theorem lies in the subtle interplay between truth that is contextual and provability within that context:

- Gödel’s theorem shows that there are true statements in any formal system (such as PA) that cannot be *proved* within the system.
- However, Gödel also constructed his theorem within the framework of PA, embedding its logic into the arithmetic operations and properties of the system itself.

Adding to this, the notion of “proof” is carefully distinguished in different contexts that are simultaneously at play. When we say that Gödel’s theorem cannot be proved *within* a formal system, we mean that the system cannot internally confirm the truth of all Gödelian statements. Yet, the theorem itself may still be *provable* in a meta-theoretical sense, which allows us to step outside the system to construct a valid proof.
